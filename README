бн [ B U G ] : 
when I do rmvStop() in a loop in main() many times, at first, the program runs well.
but in the 4-th loop, main() can't recive a succussful-return from rmvStop().
[ Solution ] : 
So I print out some codes in rmvStop().
And then I observed that, 

	...
	stopNum is :  319  .
	tokenSize is : 300 .
	...
	stopNum is :  638  .
	tokenSize is : 300 .
	...
	stopNum is :  957  .
	tokenSize is : 300 .
 
Therefore, in txtToArray(), I must reset stopNum to zero.
SO COOL !!!!!!!  The bug is fixed !!!
 
бн [ B U G ] : 
I need to press "Enter" key on keyboard 1095 times for the for-loop in main( ) to loop 1095 times.
Solution : 
Yeah ! Nicole debugs successfully by herself ! 
Discard this line in porter.cpp : system("PAUSE");

бн [ B U G ] :
Too many open files 
In iteration xxxx i get an "Too many open files" error when opening the xxxx-th file.
Solution : 
Yeah ! Nicole debugs successfully by herself ! 
Nicole must add this line of code in function txtToArray( ) : 
	   fclose(txtFile);

Haha ! Don't forget that txtFile is declared 1095 times because everytime when txtToArray( ) is entered, 
this line will declare again txtFile : void txtToArray( FILE *txtFile, char twoDimArr[][ MAX_STR_LEN ], int & wordCount )	 
Haha ! Just be careful !
